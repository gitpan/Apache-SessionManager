This directory contains various perl modules patches

- Apache-Session-File-Lock1.54-patch

This patch fixs a bug in Apache::Session::Lock::File 'clean' method
when it checks lockfiles last access time
To apply the patch do (before installing Apache::Session 1.54):

   $> cd /path/to/src/Apache-Session-1.54
   $> patch -p0 < /path/to/Apache-Session-File-Lock1.54-patch

Note: Since Apache::Session >= 1.60 has been fixed, isn't necessary to patch it.

- PLP-3.18.patch

This patch allows you to use directly a global variable $session in your PLP
pages. To apply the patch do (before installing PLP 3.18):

   $> cd /path/to/src/PLP-3.18
   $> patch -p0 < /path/to/PLP-3.18.patch

However you could use session management even without patching PLP.pm at
the cost of a bit of extra code in your CGI scripts.
See Apache::SessionManager::cookpod's "Apache::SessionManager WITH PLP" for
more info and examples.
